# Vanilla-VisualOdometry

I created this project as a study exercise to implement a simple Visual Odometry system in Python.
Please note that this project is currently in development.

This project is aimed at devices that can capture camera images and depth images, such as those using the TUM Dataset or Oak-D.

## Result
Not good result.
